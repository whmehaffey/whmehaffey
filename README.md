- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Hamish Mehaffey, current @ the Brainard Lab, working on songbirds @ UCSF (former Doupe lab, former electric fish person). 

Interested in neural imaging, electrophysiology, behavioral analyis both auditory and video, and methods for dealing with sounds. 

This is mostly a pile of stuff I've written either for song-triggered acquisition (for getting songs from birds!) that interacts with MicroManager, USB Webcams, or that does Screening or Tutoring or Callback experiments. Some MicroManager plugins as well.
